HTML Quick Guide


HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language that creates the web page, points to all of the other files needed to make the page.



 What HTML Does

 Defines the structure of a page: the header, navigation, main content, page sections, footer and more
 Marks the content on the page: headings, paragraphs, lists, media and more
 Tells the browser where to find other files needed: CSS, JavaScript, image, audio, video
 Allows you to create links to other pages or websites



 Key Concepts

 Pages begin with a doctype and the html element
 Content goes inside the body
 The body has three main structural areas: header, main, footer
 Use headings to organize information (h1 for the main title, h2 for sections, h3 and below for subsections)
 Paragraphs are written with p tags
 Lists can be ordered (numbered) or unordered (bulleted)
 Links connect your content to other resources
 Semantic HTML means that you put content in the right structural area and match the element you use to the content (example heading in h1 or list in ul ).
